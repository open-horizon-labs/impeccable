## Packaging Fork

This repository is a packaging fork of [pbakaus/impeccable](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable), restructured for installation via `npx skills add`. The original work, including all skill content, commands, and design guidance, was created by Paul Bakaus.

Changes in this fork:
- Removed website infrastructure (server, API, build pipeline)
- Restructured for `npx skills` compatibility (commands converted to skills)
- Updated documentation for npx-first installation
