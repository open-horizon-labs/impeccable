# Motion Design

## Duration: The 100/300/500 Rule

Timing matters more than easing. These durations feel right for most UI:

| Duration | Use Case | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **100-150ms** | Instant feedback | Button press, toggle, color change |
| **200-300ms** | State changes | Menu open, tooltip, hover states |
| **300-500ms** | Layout changes | Accordion, modal, drawer |
| **500-800ms** | Entrance animations | Page load, hero reveals |

**Exit animations are faster than entrances**—use ~75% of enter duration.

## Easing: Pick the Right Curve

**Don't use `ease`.** It's a compromise that's rarely optimal. Instead:

| Curve | Use For | CSS |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **ease-out** | Elements entering | `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` |
| **ease-in** | Elements leaving | `cubic-bezier(0.7, 0, 0.84, 0)` |
| **ease-in-out** | State toggles (there → back) | `cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1)` |

**For micro-interactions, use exponential curves**—they feel natural because they mimic real physics (friction, deceleration):

```css
/* Quart out - smooth, refined (recommended default) */
--ease-out-quart: cubic-bezier(0.25, 1, 0.5, 1);

/* Quint out - slightly more dramatic */
--ease-out-quint: cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1);

/* Expo out - snappy, confident */
--ease-out-expo: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
```

**Avoid bounce and elastic curves.** They were trendy in 2015 but now feel tacky and amateurish. Real objects don't bounce when they stop—they decelerate smoothly. Overshoot effects draw attention to the animation itself rather than the content.

## The Only Two Properties You Should Animate

**transform** and **opacity** only—everything else causes layout recalculation. For height animations (accordions), use `grid-template-rows: 0fr → 1fr` instead of animating `height` directly.

## Staggered Animations

Use CSS custom properties for cleaner stagger: `animation-delay: calc(var(--i, 0) * 50ms)` with `style="--i: 0"` on each item. **Cap total stagger time**—10 items at 50ms = 500ms total. For many items, reduce per-item delay or cap staggered count.

## Reduced Motion

This is not optional. Vestibular disorders affect ~35% of adults over 40.

```css
/* Define animations normally */
.card {
  animation: slide-up 500ms ease-out;
}

/* Provide alternative for reduced motion */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .card {
    animation: fade-in 200ms ease-out;  /* Crossfade instead of motion */
  }
}

/* Or disable entirely */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

**What to preserve**: Functional animations like progress bars, loading spinners (slowed down), and focus indicators should still work—just without spatial movement.

## Performance

Don't use `will-change` preemptively—only when animation is imminent (`:hover`, `.animating`). For scroll-triggered animations, use Intersection Observer instead of scroll events; unobserve after animating once. Create motion tokens for consistency (durations, easings, common transitions).

---

**Avoid**: Animating everything (animation fatigue is real). Using >500ms for UI feedback. Ignoring `prefers-reduced-motion`. Using animation to hide slow loading.
